# Juice Box

A virtual machine designed for programming workshops.

Based on [boxcutter/ubuntu](https://github.com/boxcutter/ubuntu).

## Reason

Technical workshops shouldn't be about installing a development environment in Linux, Windows, OS X, or whatever else. Unless that's what they are about, this takes way too much time from everyone and it's a pain.

## Specs

This project includes two [Packer](https://packer.io/) templates:

- server.json - No desktop environment.
- desktop.json - Xubuntu desktop environment.

Both of them build a virtual machine based on `Ubuntu Server 14.04` with the the following software installed:

- [Git](https://github.com/jpadilla/dev-box/blob/master/scripts/provisioning/git.sh)
- [Python 2.7 with pip, virtualenv, and virtualenvwrapper](https://github.com/jpadilla/dev-box/blob/master/scripts/provisioning/python.sh)
- [io.js with nvm](https://github.com/jpadilla/dev-box/blob/master/scripts/provisioning/iojs.sh)
- [Ruby 2.1 with RVM](https://github.com/jpadilla/dev-box/blob/master/scripts/provisioning/ruby.sh)
- [MongoDB](https://github.com/jpadilla/dev-box/blob/master/scripts/provisioning/mongodb.sh)
- [Redis](https://github.com/jpadilla/dev-box/blob/master/scripts/provisioning/redis.sh)
- [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/jpadilla/dev-box/blob/master/scripts/provisioning/postgresql.sh)
- [Docker](https://github.com/jpadilla/dev-box/blob/master/scripts/provisioning/docker.sh)
- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
- [Nano](http://www.nano-editor.org/)

Desktop version has the following installed:

- [Sublime Text 3](https://github.com/jpadilla/juicebox/blob/master/scripts/provisioning/sublime-text-3.sh)
- [Google Chrome](https://github.com/jpadilla/juicebox/blob/master/scripts/provisioning/google-chrome.sh)
- [Firefox](https://github.com/jpadilla/juicebox/blob/master/scripts/provisioning/firefox.sh)

## Distributing

I'll be building OVA files and Vagrant boxes for each version and hosting them.
